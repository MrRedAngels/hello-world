# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.

Hello everyone, I'm Angels, I have a degree in mathematics and I'm a lover of programming as hobby.
My favorite language is Java, but nowdays I have my own project on web development.
I love the logical, so the back-end is not a problem for me, but I confess I'm not so confident about design, what color should I use?
